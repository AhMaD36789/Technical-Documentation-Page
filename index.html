      <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

        C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

        C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

        The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.</p>
      <header>Why Use C++</header>
      <p>
        C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

        C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.

        C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be
        reused, lowering development costs.

        C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

        C++ is fun and easy to learn!

        As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

      <p>To start using C++, you need some things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code</li>
        <li>A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand</li>
        <li>There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. I recommend IDE</li>
        <li>There are also many helpful websites to learn programming as a complete beginner I recommend W3Schools</li>
        <li>When learning C++ at W3Schools.com, you can use our "Try it Yourself" tool, which shows both the code and
          the result. This will make it easier for you to understand every part as we move forward:</li>
      </ul>
      <p>C++ offers the feature of portability or platform independence which allows the user to run the same program on
        different operating systems or interfaces at ease.

        Suppose you write a program in LINUX OS and for some apparent reason you switch to Windows OS, you would be able
        to run the same program in windows as well without any error. This feature proves to be of great convenience to
        the programmer.</p>

      <p>Difference between C and C++</p>
      <p>C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.

        The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">

      <header>Data_Types</header>
      <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.

        In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), <br> for example:<br>

        int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123 <br>

        double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99 <br>
        char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes <br>
        string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes <br>
        bool - stores values with two states: true or false</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
      <header>Hello_World</header>
      <p></p>
      <code>// C++ program to display "Hello World" <br>
<br>
        // Header file for input output functions <br>
        #include <span class="iostream">iostream</span > <br>
        using namespace std; <br>
        <br>
        // Main() function: where the execution of program begins <br>
        int main() <br>
        { <br>
          // prints hello world <br>
          cout <span class="cout"></span> "Hello World"; <br>
        <br>
          return 0;<br>
        }<br>
        </code>
      <p></p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="If_Statement">
      <header>If_Statement</header>
      <p>know that C++ supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics: <br>
        <br>
        Less than: a < b <br>
          Less than or equal to: a <= b<br>
            Greater than: a > b<br>
            Greater than or equal to: a >= b<br>
            Equal to a == b<br>
            Not Equal to: a != b<br> <br>
            Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true <br>
            Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false <br>
            Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false<br>
            Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed<br>
            <br>
      </p>
      <code>if (20 > 18) {<br>
        cout <span class="cout"></span> "20 is greater than 18";<br>
      }<br><br><br>
    </code>
      <code>int x = 20;<br>
        int y = 18;<br>
        if (x > y) {<br>
          cout <span class="cout"></span> "x is greater than y";<br>
        }<br><br></code>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="For_Statement">
      <header>For_Statement</header>
      <p>Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.<br>
        <br>
        Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.<br>
        <br>
        Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.<br>
        <br>
        The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:<br>
      </p>
      <code><br>
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {<br>
          cout << i << "\n";<br>
        }<br><br>
      </code>
      <code>for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i = i + 2) {<br>
        cout << i << "\n";<br>
      }<br></code>
